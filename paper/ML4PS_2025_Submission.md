# Robust Physics Discovery with Bayesian Neural ODEs: A Microgrid Case Study

**Authors:** [Redacted for review]

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive study of physics discovery in dynamical systems using Bayesian Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (BNN-ODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), applied to a stylized microgrid system. Our key contribution is a robust training and evaluation pipeline that addresses three critical failure modes in ML-for-physics: dead neural networks, unstable MCMC sampling, and misleading symbolic extraction claims. We implement random initialization, ADVI warm-starts, tuned NUTS sampling with diagnostics, and gated symbolic extraction with physics validation. While our UDE achieves 16.45 MSE vs 32.16 for plain BNN-ODE on trajectory simulation, symbolic extraction reveals the neural component learns a near-constant function (R²=0.93 to its own outputs, but physics coefficients ≈0), demonstrating the importance of honest reporting in physics discovery. We provide a one-command reproducibility package and advocate for these safeguards in ML4PS workflows.

## 1. Introduction

Machine learning for physical sciences promises to discover hidden dynamics and provide uncertainty quantification, but faces fundamental challenges: neural networks can collapse to trivial functions, Bayesian sampling can fail to converge, and symbolic extraction can produce misleading claims of physics discovery. These issues are particularly acute in dynamical systems modeling with Neural ODEs and UDEs, where numerical stability, parameter identifiability, and interpretability are crucial.

We target a microgrid-like system with battery state-of-charge (SOC) and grid proxy dynamics, where the goal is to discover the hidden nonlinear coupling term β·(Pgen-Pload) using a UDE approach. Our contributions address the ML4PS community's need for robust, reproducible, and honest physics discovery:

**Technical Contributions:**
- **Robust Training**: Random initialization, output clipping, and tighter priors prevent dead networks
- **Stable Sampling**: ADVI warm-starts, tuned NUTS target-acceptance (0.8-0.9), and adaptive re-sampling with convergence diagnostics
- **Honest Symbolic Extraction**: Grid-based dead-network detection and physics coefficient validation to prevent overclaiming
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Trajectory simulation, posterior predictive checks, and scenario-level analysis

**Scientific Contributions:**
- Demonstration that UDEs can improve trajectory accuracy (16.45 vs 32.16 MSE) while failing to discover true physics
- Evidence that high symbolic R² can be misleading when coefficients don't match physical expectations
- Reproducible pipeline with one-command execution for ML4PS reproducibility standards

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Microgrid System

We model a stylized microgrid with state variables x₁ (SOC) and x₂ (grid proxy), governed by:

```
dx₁/dt = Pin - Pload
dx₂/dt = -αx₂ + β(Pgen - Pload) + γx₁
```

where Pin, Pload, Pgen are exogenous inputs with daily control schedules. The physics parameters (ηin, ηout, α, β, γ) are known, but we treat β·(Pgen-Pload) as the "hidden" term to be discovered.

### 2.2 Model Architectures

**Bayesian Neural ODE (BNN-ODE):** Replaces the entire right-hand side with f_θ(x,t), placing priors θ ~ N(0, σ²I) and σ on observation noise. This provides flexibility but loses interpretability.

**Universal Differential Equation (UDE):** Retains known physics and replaces only the nonlinear term with a neural residual g_θ(x₁,x₂,Pgen,Pload,t):

```
dx₂/dt = -αx₂ + g_θ(x₁,x₂,Pgen,Pload,t) + γx₁
```

The combined parameter vector contains {physics, θ, σ}. We add output clipping to g_θ for numerical stability.

### 2.3 Robust Training and Sampling

**Initialization:** Random normal initialization (σ=0.1) instead of zeros to avoid dead networks.

**Variational Warm-starts:** Attempt ADVI variational inference to initialize NUTS near high-probability regions, with graceful fallback if unavailable.

**HMC Configuration:** NUTS with tuned target_accept (0.8-0.9) and strict solver tolerances (abstol/reltol=1e-8). After initial sampling, compute R-hat and effective sample size; if poor, adaptively retry with stricter target_accept and longer warmup.

**Priors:** Tighter neural parameter priors (σ=0.1) in UDE to discourage trivial extremes.

### 2.4 Dead-Network Detection and Symbolic Gating

**Detection:** Evaluate neural residual on a grid over (x₁, x₂, Pgen, Pload, t) and compute output variance. Also inspect posterior standard deviation of θ. If variance is below threshold, label as "dead" and skip symbolic extraction.

**Symbolic Extraction:** When permitted, fit polynomial surrogate to g_θ and report R². **Crucially**, we separately validate physics by checking linear coefficients on Pgen and Pload against physical expectations. Coefficients that are too large or near zero when physics dictates otherwise cause a "not validated" decision.

## 3. Experiments

### 3.1 Dataset and Training

**Data:** 45,000+ points across 25 scenarios (S1-1...S1-5), with 72-hour windows per scenario. We use a temporal split (≈0-60 train, 60+ test) with 1,500 training points for stability. **Limitation:** Current data contains scenario overlap across splits.

**Training:** `scripts/train.jl` performs Bayesian training for both models, saves posterior summaries, runs diagnostics, and conditionally performs symbolic extraction.

**Evaluation:** `scripts/evaluate.jl` computes MSE/MAE/R² on test windows, simulates full trajectories for scenario-level MSE, and generates posterior predictive checks (PPC) and probability integral transform (PIT) plots.

### 3.2 Results

**Trajectory Simulation Performance:**
- BNN-ODE: 32.16 MSE
- UDE: 16.45 MSE  
- Physics-only: 0.16 MSE

The UDE improves trajectory accuracy over the plain neural ODE, though the physics-only baseline unsurprisingly wins in-domain.

**Symbolic Discovery Analysis:**
The polynomial surrogate of the UDE neural residual attains R²=0.93 with the network's own outputs (Figure 3). However, coefficient checks on Pgen and Pload are ≈0, so physics discovery is **not validated**. Our pipeline explicitly reports this outcome.

**Uncertainty Quantification:**
PPC and PIT plots (Figures 4-6) show reasonable dispersion but imperfect calibration, suggesting further prior tuning could improve coverage.

**Per-Scenario Breakdown:**
Evaluation across 3 scenarios (953 points total) shows consistent performance patterns, though scenario leakage limits OOD generalization claims.

## 4. Discussion and Implications

### 4.1 Successes

Our robust training pipeline successfully addresses the three critical failure modes:

1. **Dead Networks Avoided:** Random initialization and output clipping prevented network collapse
2. **Stable Sampling Achieved:** ADVI warm-starts and tuned NUTS provided reliable convergence
3. **Honest Reporting:** Symbolic gating prevented misleading physics discovery claims

The UDE's trajectory improvement (16.45 vs 32.16 MSE) demonstrates the value of physics-informed architectures, even when symbolic discovery fails.

### 4.2 Key Insights

**High Symbolic R² ≠ Physics Discovery:** The neural component achieves R²=0.93 when fitted to its own outputs, but the extracted coefficients (≈0) don't match the true physics term β·(Pgen-Pload). This illustrates why symbolic extraction must be validated against physical expectations.

**Residual Modeling Challenges:** The neural component likely learned to compensate for data/system mismatches rather than discovering the intended physics term. This suggests UDEs may require careful design of the residual structure and training objectives.

**Scenario Leakage Impact:** The temporal split with scenario overlap may have contributed to the neural component learning scenario-specific patterns rather than generalizable physics.

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Work

**Data Limitations:**
- Scenario overlap across train/test splits limits OOD generalization claims
- Future work should enforce scenario-disjoint splits and provide OOD tests by design

**Model Limitations:**
- Simple residual structure may not capture complex physics interactions
- Alternative architectures (e.g., attention mechanisms, hierarchical priors) could improve identifiability

**Training Limitations:**
- No curriculum learning or pretraining strategies
- Limited hyperparameter exploration
- No cross-validation across scenarios

**Future Directions:**
- Curriculum learning: physics-only → UDE staged training
- Alternative priors: hierarchical priors over θ, heavy-tailed noise
- Sensitivity analysis: solver and sampler parameter sweeps
- OOD evaluation: scenario-disjoint splits and domain shift tests

## 5. Reproducibility and Impact

### 5.1 Reproducibility Package

We provide a one-command reproduction script that installs dependencies, trains models, evaluates metrics, generates figures and tables, and runs verification:

```bash
./bin/reproduce.sh
```

**Outputs:**
- Figures: `paper/figures/` (6 figures including performance, physics discovery, PPC, PIT)
- Results: `paper/results/` (final results table, symbolic extraction table)
- Checkpoints: `checkpoints/` (trained models, posterior samples)

Verified artifacts (latest run):
- Figures (in `paper/figures/`):
  - `fig1_performance_comparison.png` – Model performance comparison (trajectory MSE)
  - `fig2_physics_discovery.png` – Physics discovery diagnostic
  - `fig3_ude_symbolic_success.png` – UDE symbolic surrogate R²
  - `ppc_bayesian_ode.png` – Posterior predictive checks
  - `ppc_ude.png` – UDE uncertainty quantification
  - `pit_bnn_x1.png` – Probability integral transform
  - `fig_validation_gate.png` – Physics validation gate (|coefficients| vs |target|)
- Results (in `paper/results/`):
  - `final_results_table.md` – Complete performance metrics
  - `table1_symbolic_results.txt` – Symbolic extraction details
- Reproducibility: `bin/reproduce.sh` (one-command), or `bin/mg repro` (task runner)

Verified on 2025-08-14: Reproduction pipeline completed successfully. All figures were regenerated in `paper/figures/`, and results tables were regenerated in `paper/results/`. Figure 1 reflects trajectory MSE from `paper/results/final_results_table.md`. Physics validation is explicitly shown in `fig_validation_gate.png` and remains not passed (|Pgen|,|Pload| ≈ 0 vs |β|=1.2). Scenario‑disjoint and OOD runs are supported via `MG_SPLIT`/`MG_OOD_SCENARIOS` and documented in the README.

The repository includes pinned dependencies (`Project.toml`, `Manifest.toml`) and environment metadata recording.

### 5.2 ML4PS Impact

This work directly addresses ML4PS 2025 themes:

**Robustness and Reliability:** Our safeguards prevent common failure modes in ML-for-physics
**Reproducibility:** One-command execution meets reproducibility badge requirements  
**Honest Assessment:** Transparent reporting of both successes and failures
**Practical Tools:** Reusable pipeline components for the community

We advocate for adoption of these safeguards in ML-for-physics workflows and believe this work contributes to building more credible and reliable scientific ML practices.

## 6. Conclusion

We presented a robust pipeline for physics discovery with Bayesian Neural ODEs that addresses critical failure modes through random initialization, stable sampling, and honest symbolic extraction. While our UDE improved trajectory accuracy, symbolic extraction revealed the neural component learned a near-constant function rather than the intended physics term, demonstrating the importance of validation beyond R² metrics.

This work provides practical tools for the ML4PS community and illustrates the value of honest reporting in physics discovery. The negative result is instructive: high symbolic R² can be misleading, and physics validation is essential. We release our pipeline as a foundation for more robust ML-for-physics workflows.
