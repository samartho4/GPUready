# ROADMAP COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
Generated: 2025-08-16T01:11:28.306

ðŸŽ¯ EXACT ROADMAP IMPLEMENTATION:

STATE VARIABLES (Matching Roadmap):
  x1(t) = Energy stored in battery [kWh]
  x2(t) = Net power flow through grid [kW]

ODE EQUATIONS (Exact from Screenshot):
  Energy Storage: dx1/dt = Î·inÂ·u(t)Â·1{u(t)>0} - (1/Î·out)Â·u(t)Â·1{u(t)<0} - d(t)
  Grid Power Flow: dx2/dt = -Î±x2(t) + Î²Â·(Pgen(t) - Pload(t)) + Î³Â·x1(t)

OBJECTIVES ALIGNMENT:
  âœ… 1. Bayesian Neural ODE: Replace full ODE system
  âœ… 2. UDE: Replace Î²Â·Pgen(t) term with neural network
  âœ… 3. Symbolic: Extract neural network symbolic form

DATASET STATISTICS:
  Training: 4 samples
  Validation: 4 samples
  Test: 4 samples

DISTRIBUTION OVERLAP:
  x1 overlap: 97.8%
  x2 overlap: 100.0%

STATUS: âœ… FULLY ALIGNED WITH ROADMAP
